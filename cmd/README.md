How to run the system

1. type "make tools" to install the necessary tools, such as Goose and sqlc

Note: Goose is used to manage sql migration (including the creation of database tables),
sqlc is used to generate sql queries and database related code automatically.
the code generated by sqlc is put under resources/database/sqlc/internal

2. type "make up_build" to build the application and run docker-compose.yml to load all
   the dependencies
   Note: If local application has not any change, just skip this step and go to the next step

3. type "make up" to initiate the whole application and dependencies

4. Open postman, and try to test the micro-service
   Get, http://localhost/playlist, return a welcome message
   Post http://localhost/playlist/new, pass the JSON file as body (Not finish yet)

5. type "make down" to stop the system.

Note:
If you want to run the micro service in the host machine directly:
a. open .env in the root directory, change DB_HOST=localhost
b. Change the same .env stuff in cmd directory

Other usage:

1. Any database queries could be generated automatically by using sqlc

a. Go to the folder resources/database/sqlc
b. change anything in the query.sql about CRUD operation
c. type sqlc generate
Content will be generated within internal sub directory. Copy what you need to
your .go files and make any changes necessary

Note:
after updating to the colima,
volume of the postgresql is not supported, so
remove the following two lines from the docker-compose.yml

---

    volumes:
      - ./db-data/postgres/:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
